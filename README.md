As part of Hunter College's MS in Computer Science Education degree, I took 3 intensive programming courses in July 2021. Here are some featured projects from those three classes: Programming in Java, Data Structures, and Methods for Teaching Computer Science I.

# Programming in Java

# Data Structures
Created a program to solve a maze: [Maze.java](https://github.com/hunter-teacher-cert/work_csci70900-onlinecsteacher/blob/master/ds/maze/Maze.java) and [Driver.java](https://github.com/hunter-teacher-cert/work_csci70900-onlinecsteacher/blob/master/ds/maze/Driver.java)

Created a program to solve Knight's Tour: [Knights.java](https://github.com/hunter-teacher-cert/work_csci70900-onlinecsteacher/blob/master/ds/maze/Knights.java) and [Knights Tour demo](Knights_movie.mov)
